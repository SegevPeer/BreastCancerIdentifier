# Breast Cancer Identifier (BCI)

## Overview
The Breast Cancer Identifier (BCI) is a project aimed at leveraging deep learning to assist in the early detection of breast cancer. This repository contains the source code for a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to upload and analyze breast cancer images. The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify uploaded images as benign or malignant.

## Features
- Deep learning model for image classification.
- Easy-to-use interface for early breast cancer detection.

## Usage
1. Run the GUI application:
   python gui.py

2. The GUI window will open, allowing you to:
   - Browse and upload breast cancer images.
   - Analyze the uploaded image for malignancy.
   - Get the analysis result, which includes the likelihood of malignancy.
   - Mark the result label in red if the likelihood is high ( > 0.8).
